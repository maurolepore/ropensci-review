# How rOpenSci performs peer-review

*Mauro Lepore*

## Outline

* Who are you and me?
* How can this talk help you?
* The way we communicate.
* The way we build and review software.
* Questions and comments
* Takeaways.

## Who are you?

You are:

* An actual or potential community member, package author, reviewer or editor.
* Someone who might want to try our process elsewhere.

## Who am I?

I build tools to help researchers get the most out of their data.

Before I was a biologist.

My roles at rOpenSci:

* runconf participant.
* Rejected author.
* Co-author.
* Reviewer.
* Guest editor.
* Editor.
* Chief-editor.
* Mentor.

## How can this talk help you?

The whole process is complex and can feel overwhelming. 

Here we will:

* Highlight and discuss what's most important.
* Show you where you can find the rest.

## The most important stuff

[rOpenSci's software-review repo](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) links to our: 

* [Code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/): The way we communicate.
* ["devguide"](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) and: The way we build and review software.

And:

* Also shows "why" bother but today we'll focus on "how" to do it.
* Seems to lack a link to our ["stats devguide"](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/).

## The way we communicate: Why is it so important?

> [Helping to improve software] in a kind and respectful way is just as
important as the technical aspect -- Yani

TODO: Discuss

## The way we communicate: On kindness

The article [Setting expectations for open source participation](https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/amp/)
says:

> You could view everything in [open source software] as a kindness that someone
has done for you and others. Taking the altruistic view of open source keeps
things grounded and healthy.

> It's like when I hold the door open for someone. (...) When someone in open
source makes demands it's like the person passing through the door criticizing
how I held the door open. It ... leads to people no longer being willing to hold
open doors for others.
